1. What is divide and conquer algorithms: are a design paradigm that works by recursively breaking down a problem into sub-problems of similar type,
    until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
    The solution to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

                                                        Main problem
                                                        /           \
                                                       /             \       -> Divide
                                                      /               \
                                             Sub problem 1        Sub problem 2
                                               /  \                     /  \
                                              /    \                   /    \
                                             /      \                 /      \
                                          sub1      sub2            sub1    sub2
                                             \       /               \        /
                                              \     /                 \      /
                                           Subs1 solution          Subs2 solution
                                                  \                     /
                                                   \                   /     -> Merge
                                                    \                 /
                                                   Main problem solution

2. Properties of divide and conquer Algorithms:
   -> Optimal substructure: if any problems overall optimal solution can be constructed from
       the optimal solutions of its subproblems then this problem has optimal structure.

3. why do we need it?
   -> it is very efficient when the problem has optimal substructure property.

4. Common divide and conquer algorithms:
   A. Merge sort
   B. Quick sort
   C. Fibonacci number
