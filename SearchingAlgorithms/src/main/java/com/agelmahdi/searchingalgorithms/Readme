1. Binary Search:
  A. Is faster than linear search.
  B. Half of the remaining elements can be eliminated at a time, instead of eliminating one be one.
  C. Works only for Sorted Array.

2. Binary search Pseudocode:

  A. Create a function with two parameters which are a sorted array and a value.
  B. Create two pointers: a left pointer at the start of the array, and the right pointer to the end of the array.
  C. Based on left and right pointers calculate the middle pointer,
  D. While the middle is not equal to the value and start <= end loop:
      -if the middle is greater than the value move the right pointer down
      -if the middle is less than the value move the left pointer up
  E. if the value is never found return -1.
