1. What is a graph?
  - Graph consists of a finite set of vertices or (Nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

2. Graph Terminology
  A. Vertices are the node of the graph.
  B. Edge: is the line that connects pairs of vertices.
  C. Unweighted Graph:  A graph that does not have a weight associated with an edge.
  D. Weighted Graph:  A graph that has a weight associated with an edge.
  E. Undirected Graph:  In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction between them.
  F. Directed Graph:  In case the edges of the graph have a direction between them.
  G. Cyclic Graph:  a graph that has a least one loop.
  H. Acyclic Graph:  a graph that has no loop.
  I. Tree: This is a special case of a directed acyclic graph.

 4. Graph representation
   A. Adjacency matrix: an adjacency matrix is a square matrix or 2D array. and the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.

                                             _A_ _B_ _C_ _D_ _E_
                   A - - - B               A|_0_|_1_|_1_|_1_|_0_|
                   |\       \              B|_1_|_0_|_0_|_0_|_1_|
                   | \       \             C|_1_|_0_|_0_|_1_|_0_|
                   |  \       \            D|_1_|_0_|_1_|_0_|_1_|
                   |   \       E           E|_0_|_1_|_0_|_1_|_0_|
                   |    \     /
                   |     \   /
                   |      \ /
                   C- - -  D

   B. Adjacency List is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph.

                      A - - - B               |_A_|->|_B_|_|->|_D_|_|->|_C_|_|
                      |\       \              |_B_|->|_A_|_|->|_E_|_|
                      | \       \             |_C_|->|_A_|_|->|_D_|_|   _ _ _
                      |  \       \            |_D_|->|_A_|_|->|_C_|_|->|_E_|_|
                      |   \       E           |_E_|->|_B_|_|->|_D_|_|
                      |    \     /
                      |     \   /
                      |      \ /
                      C- - -  D

   -> When to use?
     A. Adjacency matrix: if the graph is complete or almost complete which means all cells have 1's.
     A. Adjacency List: if the number of edges is few then we should use Adjacency List.
