1.What is Hashing?
- Hashing is a method of sorting and indexing data. which allow large amount of data to be indexed using keys

2.Why Hashing?
- it is a time efficient in case of SEARCH operation
   -> Arrays -> O(log(n))
   -> LinkedList -> O(n)
   -> Tree -> O(log(n))
   -> Hashing -> O(1) / O(n) in case of collision

3. Hashing Terminology
 - Hash function: it is a function that can be used to map of arbitrary size to data of fixed size
 - Key: the input data is given by a user
 - Hash value: A value that is returned by hash function
 - Hash Table: its a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map key to values
 - Collision: A Collision occurs when two different keys to hash function produced the same output

4. Properties of a good hash function
 - it distributes hash values uniformaly across hash tables
 - it has to use all the input data

5. Collision Resolution technique
  1. Direct Chaining: hash table is an array of references using a linkedList
  2. Open Addressing
    - Linear probing
    - Quadratic probing
    - Double probing
